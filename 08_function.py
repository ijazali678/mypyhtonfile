#what is function e.g print function
#these are already build code which give him output

# print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")
# print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")
# print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")
# print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")

#making or defining of your own function def use and prentesis
# 1 the first way 

#defining a function

# def alijin():
#     print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")
#     print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")
#     print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")
#     print("i am learning python with ijaz ali")

# alijin()

# 2 the second way

# def alijin():
#     test=("i am learning python with ijaz ali")
#     print(test)
#     print(test)

# alijin()

# 3 the third way

# def alijin(text):
#     print(text)
#     print(text)

# alijin("i am learning python with ijaz ali")


#4 the fouth way if in elif conditon

# def school_calculater(age,text):
#     if age == 5:
#         print("he can join the school")
#     elif age >15:
#         print("he can join the higher school")
#     else:
#         print("he is still a baby")

# school_calculater(4,"ali")


def future_age(age):
    new_age=age+10
    return new_age
    print(new_age)

future_age = future_age(25)
print(future_age)
